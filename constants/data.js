      `I have loved computer science since junior high school, especially about computer networks. From there I tried to build a network for my village that is not covered by the internet (fiber optic) so that residents can experience unlimited internet at a low price.`,
      `My first programming language was c++ & html in vocational high school ðŸ˜‚. Over time, I started using the laravel framework and implemented it in several projects.`,
      `Being a project manager makes me have a new perspective on the process of making applications, one of which is the process of deploying applications until they are used by users. From there I started to like the world of cloud computing and became a hobby.`,
